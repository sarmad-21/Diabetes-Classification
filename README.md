# Classifying Diabetic/Prediabetic Individuals 

## Overview 
This project focuses on classifying individuals as diabetic/prediabetic or non-diabetic using health, lifestyle, and demographic related features. We performed data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and basic feature extraction to prepare the dataset for modeling. Two classical statistical models are then used to predict whether an individual is diabetic/prediabetic or non-diabetic: **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** and **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**. This projects objective is to apply machine learning models for public health.
